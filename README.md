# Admarus

Admarus is a peer-to-peer search engine for IPFS. It is based on the [Kamilata](https://github.com/mubelotix/kamilata) protocol.

This repository contains a lightweight daemon for Admarus. The daemon works in tandem with the [Kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) IPFS daemon. Files you pin with Kubo will be indexed by Admarus, and made available to the network. No additional storage is required by the Admarus daemon.
