# admarus-census

Admarus-Census is a central server program designed to track various statistics about the Admarus network.
It serves as a valuable tool for monitoring and analyzing network activity, including node count, file count, file distribution, and more.
Additionally, it helps nodes find each other during the bootstrap process.

Admarus-Census provides an API for retrieving statistics.

The use of this server is **entirely optional** and the [Admarus daemon](https://github.com/mubelotix/admarus-daemon) does not rely on this server to function.
